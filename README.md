# SVM-Face-recognition
Design of face recognition model for a video image data, using Support vector machine and Histogram of orientation for feature extraction.

frontal_haar - It is used for saving face detection images from video for HOG features extraction.

Feature_extraction - 1)It is used for extracting HOG features from images
2) Save features and labels as numpy array which is used for training purpose. 

Training - It is used to train the SVM model.

Video_live_labelling - It is used for live test video labelling. 

Labels - It contains ground truth for train dataset 

Features - It contains the extracted HOG features for train dataset.
